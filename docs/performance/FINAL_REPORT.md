**Backend Performance:**
- API response times (P50, P95, P99) per endpoint
- Database query duration and count
- Memory usage and leak detection
- Connection pool utilization
- Error rate and type distribution

**Frontend Performance:**
- Initial page load time (Lighthouse score)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Memory usage over session duration

**Infrastructure:**
- CPU usage per service
- Memory usage per container
- Network latency and throughput
- Disk I/O
- PostgreSQL slow query log

### Recommended Tools Stack

1. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):**
   - Option A: Sentry (error tracking + performance)
   - Option B: Datadog APM (distributed tracing)
   - Option C: New Relic (full-stack monitoring)

2. **Metrics & Dashboards:**
   - Prometheus (metric collection)
   - Grafana (visualization and dashboards)
   - AlertManager (alerting)

3. **Frontend Monitoring:**
   - Lighthouse CI (automated audits)
   - Web Vitals (real user monitoring)
   - Sentry Browser SDK (errors + performance)

4. **Database Monitoring:**
   - PostgreSQL native logging
   - pgBadger (log analyzer)
   - pg_stat_statements (query performance)

### Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical | Action |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| API response time (P95) | >300ms | >500ms | Scale backend |
| Memory usage | >75% | >90% | Investigate leak |
| Database connections | >80% | >95% | Increase pool |
| Error rate | >1% | >5% | Page on-call |
| Page load time | >3s | >5s | Deploy hotfix |

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Load Testing Protocol

**Tool:** Locust or k6

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Baseline Load:**
   - 50 concurrent users
   - 500 devices in database
   - 5-minute duration
   - Measure: response times, error rate, throughput

2. **Peak Load:**
   - 200 concurrent users
   - 2000 devices
   - 10-minute duration
   - Simulate bulk status updates

3. **Stress Test:**
   - Gradually increase load until system degrades
   - Identify breaking point
   - Measure: max throughput, failure mode

**Test Script Example:**
```python
# locustfile.py
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class UNOCUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)
    
    @task(3)
    def get_devices(self):
        self.client.get("/api/devices")
    
    @task(1)
    def get_device_detail(self):
        self.client.get("/api/devices/1")
```

### Benchmarking Workflow

1. **Before each optimization:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   pytest --durations=10
   python -m cProfile -o baseline.prof run.py
   
   # Frontend
   npm run build
   lighthouse http://localhost:5173 --output=json --output-path=baseline.json
   
   # Database
   psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;"
   ```

2. **Apply optimization**

3. **After optimization:**
   - Re-run all profiling commands
   - Compare metrics with baseline
   - Document improvement percentage

### Continuous Performance Monitoring

**In CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Run Lighthouse CI on every PR (frontend)
- Track pytest duration trends (backend)
- Fail PR if performance regresses >10%

**In Production:**
- Real user monitoring (RUM) with Sentry or similar
- Synthetic monitoring (periodic Lighthouse audits)
- APM distributed tracing for slow requests
