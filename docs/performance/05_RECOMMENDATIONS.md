## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)

**Goal:** Address top 3 bottlenecks causing most pain

1. **[Fix Title]**
   - Description: _What to do_
   - Files: _List_
   - Effort: _Hours_
   - Expected Impact: _X% improvement_

2. **[Fix Title]**
   - ...

### Week 2: High-Priority Optimizations

**Goal:** Implement database indexing, query optimization, frontend rendering improvements

1. **Add Database Indexes**
   - Tables: devices, interfaces, links
   - Columns: device_id, interface_id (foreign keys)
   - Impact: 50-70% query time reduction

2. **Optimize /api/devices Endpoint**
   - Add pagination
   - Use eager loading for relationships
   - Impact: 60% response time reduction

### Month 1: Medium-term Improvements

**Goal:** Refactor heavy components, implement caching, add monitoring

1. **Frontend Component Optimization**
   - Refactor DeviceSidebar to use v-memo
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Impact: 40% render time reduction

2. **Add Redis Caching Layer**
   - Cache frequently accessed device data
   - Invalidate on updates
   - Impact: 70% reduction in database load

### Quarter: Long-term Architecture

**Goal:** Strategic improvements for scalability

1. **Migrate to GraphQL**
   - Reduce over-fetching
   - Enable client-driven queries
   - Impact: 50% bandwidth reduction

2. **Implement Background Job Queue**
   - Move heavy operations (seeding, bulk updates) to Celery/RQ
   - Impact: Non-blocking API responses

## Monitoring & Alerting Setup

### Metrics to Track

**Backend:**
- API response times (P50, P95, P99)
- Database query duration
- Memory usage trend
- Connection pool utilization

**Frontend:**
- Page load time (Lighthouse)
- Time to Interactive
- JavaScript bundle size
- Memory usage over time

**Infrastructure:**
- PostgreSQL slow query log
- Docker container resource usage
- Network latency

### Recommended Tools

1. **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics visualization
2. **Sentry** for error tracking and performance monitoring
3. **Datadog APM** or **New Relic** for distributed tracing (optional)

### Alert Thresholds

- API response time > 500ms → Warning
- API response time > 1s → Critical
- Memory usage > 80% → Warning
- Database connection pool > 90% → Critical

---

## Performance Testing Strategy

### Load Testing

Use **Locust** or **k6** to simulate:
- 100 concurrent users
- 1000 devices in database
- Frequent status updates

### Benchmarking

Establish baseline metrics before each optimization:
```bash
# Backend
pytest --benchmark-only

# Frontend
npm run build
lighthouse http://localhost:5173 --output=json

# Database
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM devices ...
```

### Continuous Monitoring

- Run Lighthouse CI on every PR
- Track test duration trends in CI
- Monitor production metrics in Grafana

---

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| /api/devices response time | _TBD_ | <100ms | ⏳ |
| Initial page load | _TBD_ | <2s | ⏳ |
| Memory stable after 1h | _TBD_ | <10% growth | ⏳ |
| Database queries/request | _TBD_ | <5 | ⏳ |
| WebSocket latency | _TBD_ | <50ms | ⏳ |

---

## Next Actions

1. ✅ Complete performance audit (this document)
2. ⏳ Implement Week 1 critical fixes
3. ⏳ Set up monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
4. ⏳ Establish performance testing pipeline
5. ⏳ Execute Week 2 optimizations
6. ⏳ Quarterly review and long-term planning
