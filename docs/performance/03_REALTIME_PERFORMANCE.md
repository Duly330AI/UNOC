# WebSocket & Real-time Performance Analysis

**Analysis Date:** _To be filled by Codex_  
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

_Codex will analyze Socket.IO overhead, message volume, and latency._

---

## Detailed Findings

### Finding 1: [Broadcast Overhead]

**Severity:** Critical | High | Medium | Low  
**Location:** `backend/main.py` or `backend/api/routes.py`  
**Impact:** _Description_

**Current Code:**
```python
# emit_to_all example
```

**Problem:**
_Explanation of unnecessary broadcasts or large payloads_

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Optimized code (rooms, debouncing, payload reduction)
```

**Estimated Effort:** X hours  
**Estimated Impact:** Y% reduction in message volume

---

## Metrics Collected

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Avg message size | _TBD_ | <5KB | ❌ |
| Messages/sec (bulk op) | _TBD_ | <50 | ❌ |
| Latency (emit→receive) | _TBD_ | <50ms | ❌ |

---

## Quick Wins

1. **Reduce WebSocket Payload**
   - Change: Send only changed fields instead of full objects
   - Impact: _Estimate_

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement debouncing on high-frequency events
2. Use Socket.IO rooms to target clients
3. Compress large payloads
